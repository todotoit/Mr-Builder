# Setting up the development

- Clone your new project repository (if not already cloned) based on Mr-Builder
- run ```npm install``` or ```sudo npm install`` if you are on mac
- run ``` grunt dev``` to start your development session



# Setting the environment

There is a ```env.json``` file for environment configs. It's an hash that can be populated with different envs.
The key env ```default``` is required, it's the one that will be used once a grunt task ahs been launced without parameter.
If you need to set different **default** env in different machines, gitignore env.json file and put a version on each machine with the ```default``` key set properly.
Otherwise you can call a grunt task using a parameter corresponding the env key within the env.json file:

	grunt build --end=development

This command will run the build task and the object in the ```development``` key will be passed in the appData.env object.


# Regular development session

```grunt dev```

### npm run tag

### npm run sassdev

Alias of ```grunt gruntsassdev --gruntfile GruntSassDev.js```.
